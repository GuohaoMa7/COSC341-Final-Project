use mouse to drag the duck
use " "(space) to jump [animation did not draw]
use + to open a funny function. then use "+" to add ducks, use "-" to delete the ducks, max add 100 ducks.
use "a" and "d" to move. [did not finished yet], [animation did not draw]
all the functions can use voice to control. [did not finish yet]



need fix:
background change to green and dll file change the color.
when the duck sit, the duck need don't move.
add code to let the app can auto read the computer's screen size, then update the varible min and max boundary.
